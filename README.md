##  Password strength checker
  A simple password checker that validates the strength of your password.
  Future implementations include changing into an exported function that can be built into a .dll or .so
  such that it can be imported into other code from whichever the language.
  Also it can include a simple password generator that can generate a sample password and return the string form of it
